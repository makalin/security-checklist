## **Security Checklist for Web Development, APIs, and Databases**

### **1. Web Application Security**
- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both client and server sides.
  - Use allowlists (not blocklists) for input validation.
  - Protect against SQL injection, XSS, and command injection attacks.
- [ ] **Authentication and Authorization**
  - Use strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, etc.).
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Use secure session management (e.g., secure cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags).
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles.
- [ ] **Secure Communication**
  - Use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher) for all communications.
  - Enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers.
  - Avoid mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages).
- [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**
  - Escape and sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict sources of scripts and other resources.
- [ ] **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
  - Use anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.
  - Validate the origin and referer headers for sensitive requests.
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
  - Use generic error messages for users and log detailed errors securely.
- [ ] **File Uploads**
  - Restrict file types and sizes.
  - Scan uploaded files for malware.
  - Store uploaded files outside the web root or use secure access controls.
- [ ] **Security Headers**
  - Set security headers like:
    - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
    - `Content-Security-Policy`
    - `Referrer-Policy`
    - `Permissions-Policy`
- [ ] **Dependency Management**
  - Regularly update third-party libraries and frameworks.
  - Use tools like `npm audit`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`, or `Snyk` to identify vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**
  - Log security events (e.g., failed login attempts, access control violations).
  - Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
  - Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information.

### **2. API Security**
- [ ] **Authentication**
  - Use OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or API keys for authentication.
  - Avoid using Basic Auth for APIs.
  - Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- [ ] **Authorization**
  - Validate permissions for each API request.
  - Use scopes and claims to enforce fine-grained access control.
- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - Validate and sanitize all API inputs (query parameters, headers, body).
  - Use strong typing and schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema).
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
  - Use tools like Redis or API gateways for rate limiting.
- [ ] **Data Exposure**
  - Avoid exposing sensitive data in API responses.
  - Use field-level filtering to return only necessary data.
- [ ] **Secure Endpoints**
  - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints.
  - Disable HTTP methods that are not needed (e.g., DELETE, PUT).
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Return generic error messages to clients.
  - Log detailed errors securely on the server.
- [ ] **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
  - Configure CORS policies to allow only trusted origins.
  - Avoid using `*` for CORS headers.
- [ ] **Versioning**
  - Version APIs to manage changes and deprecation securely.
  - Deprecate older versions with proper notifications.
- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - Perform regular security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).
  - Use tools like Postman, OWASP ZAP, or Burp Suite for API testing.

### **3. Database Security**
- [ ] **Access Control**
  - Restrict database access to authorized users and applications.
  - Use strong passwords and role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Avoid using default accounts or credentials.
- [ ] **Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., using AES-256).
  - Encrypt data in transit using TLS.
  - Use hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for passwords and sensitive data.
- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**
  - Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.
  - Avoid dynamic SQL queries.
- [ ] **Backup and Recovery**
  - Regularly back up databases and test recovery procedures.
  - Store backups securely and encrypt them.
- [ ] **Auditing and Monitoring**
  - Enable database auditing to track access and changes.
  - Monitor for unusual activity (e.g., large data exports, unauthorized access).
- [ ] **Database Hardening**
  - Disable unused features and services.
  - Apply the latest security patches and updates.
  - Use firewalls to restrict access to the database server.
- [ ] **Data Minimization**
  - Store only the data you need.
  - Anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data where possible.
- [ ] **Environment Separation**
  - Use separate databases for development, testing, and production.
  - Avoid using production data in non-production environments.

### **4. General Security Best Practices**
- [ ] **Security Training**
  - Train developers on secure coding practices.
  - Stay updated on the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Code Reviews**
  - Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.
  - Use static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Incident Response Plan**
  - Have a plan in place to respond to security incidents.
  - Test the plan regularly.
- [ ] **Compliance**
  - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
  - Regularly audit security practices and policies.

### **5. Tools and Resources**
- [ ] **Security Tools**
  - Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nmap, and Nessus for testing.
  - Integrate security tools into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube).
- [ ] **OWASP Resources**
  - Refer to the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for common vulnerabilities.
  - Use the [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) for best practices.
- [ ] **Security Standards**
  - Follow standards like ISO 27001, NIST, and CIS benchmarks.
